 # Caf√© application
Written using Spring boot, Hibernate, Maven, MariaDB, VanillaJS.
Actually not finished, but tried to access all layers of the application: *back, front,  test*.

## To use as an app
1. First user (admin/manager) is created on startap with the email and password you can find in resources/data.sql file.
2. After logging in user's id is saved client-side and sent with further requests (to simulate token-like approach).
